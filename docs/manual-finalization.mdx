## Overview

Soniox supports **manual finalization** in addition to automatic mechanisms like
[endpoint detection](/stt/rt/endpoint-detection). Manual finalization
gives you precise control over when audio should be finalized — useful for:

* Push-to-talk systems.
* Client-side voice activity detection (VAD).
* Segment-based transcription pipelines.
* Applications where automatic endpoint detection is not ideal.

***

## How to finalize

Send a control message over the WebSocket connection:

```json
{"type": "finalize"}
```

When received:

* Soniox finalizes all audio up to that point.
* All tokens from that audio are returned with `"is_final": true`.
* The model emits a special marker token:

```json
{"text": "<fin>", "is_final": true}
```

The `<fin>` token signals that finalization is complete.

***

## Key points

* You can call `finalize` multiple times per session.
* You may continue streaming audio after each `finalize` call.
* The `<fin>` token is always returned as final and can be used to trigger downstream processing.
* Do not send `finalize` too frequently (every few seconds is fine; too often may cause disconnections).
* <LuTriangleAlert className="inline text-fd-card align-text-bottom size-6 fill-orange-400" /> You are charged for the **full stream duration,** not just the audio processed.

## Trailing silence

If you already added silence before sending finalize, you can reduce extra padding and improve latency by specifying:

```json
{
  "type": "finalize",
  "trailing_silence_ms": 300
}
```

This tells Soniox how much silence you already included.

## Connection keepalive

Combine with [connection keepalive](/stt/rt/connection-keepalive): use keepalive messages to prevent timeouts when no audio is being sent (e.g., during long pauses).
